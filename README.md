This is my feeble attempts, and I'm doing so using mostly vanilla JS but utilising node.js for reading my input- and example-files. Setup might change but for now you can run each day by running `node .` while standing in the specific dir.

*I'll try do as many as time/motivation/skill allows me to do - although you can compete with being fast AF - my only competition is to challenge myself.*
